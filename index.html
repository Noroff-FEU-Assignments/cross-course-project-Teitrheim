    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Make sure to install SSL and security plugins so you can send sensitive information through internet secure. Also a good advice is to update passwords with upper and lower cases and numbers. I would also advice to use HTTPS. Also use web security tools if you can. Your email ports should be secured so that it wont be at risk. Prevent uploading of files to your website</p>
