    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Make sure to install SSL and security plugins so you can send sensitive information through internet secure. Also a good advice is to update passwords with upper and lower cases and numbers. I would also advice to use HTTPS. Also use web security tools if you can. Your email ports should be secured so that it wont be at risk. Prevent uploading of files to your website. A network enigineer would be ideal to be responsible for network security. Have an implementation of automatic user timout so users dont hang their credentials for a long time. You should also use CI/CD wich is an atomatic process of integrating and delivering code to production. Check how many downloads the aapplication gets per week and use a well known third party application. Make sure that authorization and authentication are hard to crack. This can be done by using an open standard authorization protocol or framework like OneLogin. Make use of a third party solution, for example NodeJS to sanitize data.</p>
