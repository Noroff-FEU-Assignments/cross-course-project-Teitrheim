    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advice them to install SSL and security plugins so you can send sensitive information through internet secure. Then I would advice them to update passwords with upper and lower cases and numbers. I would also advice to use HTTPS. Use web security tools if you can.</p>
